# Sprite Dungeon Crawler
A project from [Hands-On Rust](https://hands-on-rust.com/) by Herbert Wolverson. This project mainly serves as an introduction to the Rust programming language, as well as learning material about rendering.

Still a WIP, will work on this whenever my work doesn't fill my time.

Simply clone the repo and run `cargo run` in the root directory to run the renderer.
